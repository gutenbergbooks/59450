<p class="dropcap">Any reasonable and honest attempt to explain
the origin of the singularly elegant interlaced
ornamentation, familiar to archæologists as
the very earliest style of artistic decoration
known in the British islands, must be entitled
to, and I feel assured will receive, favourable consideration.
Even should the attempted explanation fail to obtain entire
sanction, it will at least lead to attentive and accurate
observations upon an interesting subject, which may at some
future time refute or establish the theory which I venture to
propound.</p>

<p>The style of interlaced ornament to which I refer is found
in an infinite variety of devices on the earliest sculpture,
whether of stone or metal, and in the oldest manuscripts and
illuminations of Britain and Ireland. It retained its peculiar
distinctive character throughout the Roman occupation of
Britain, slightly modified by, and often mixed with, classical
ornaments. These, however, in a great measure disappeared
during the Saxon period, a circumstance which induces the
belief that, whatever its origin and purpose, interlaced ornamentation
was equally familiar to the Saxon invaders and to
the British aborigines. It entered largely into Norman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
architecture; but from the time of the Conquest it gradually
became less used, though traces of it are to be met with at
nearly every period in the history of British art. Thus it
was revived with the introduction of printing, when many
beautiful capital letters, copied from ancient manuscripts,
were reproduced as wood-cuts. It reappeared in the strap-work
peculiar to the architecture and ornamentation of the
Elizabethan and Jacobean eras. It is found in the bone-lace
patterns of this country and of Northern Europe in the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries, and was retained in almost
its original purity for the decoration of the dirks, targets,
brooches and powder horns of the Scottish Highlanders
within the last hundred years.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Very striking examples of interlaced ornament are met
with on the ancient sculptured stones and crosses so plentifully
scattered over our islands. They have been of late
brought into prominent notice by three invaluable publications
which graphically represent and accurately describe
these interesting relics of ancient art as they are now found
in Scotland<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>, Ireland<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and the Isle of Man<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>. It is to be
regretted that those of England and Wales—though many
of them have been separately engraved—have not yet been
collected in a well-edited volume, since a careful comparison
of their details would prove an immense assistance to antiquaries,
bringing before them a new and delightful chapter,
richly full of pre-historic suggestions.</p>

<p>My remarks are confined to sculptured stones only, though
the subject would be greatly elucidated and my argument enforced
by references to manuscripts and metal ornamentation.
This ground, however, is so well occupied by gentlemen who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
have made palæography and metallic art their peculiar study
that I decline intruding upon it, even had it been possible to
treat it satisfactorily within the limits of this paper.</p>

<p>The aborigines of this or any other country of corresponding
climate, after discovering some natural cave, or making
for themselves a rude hut, would probably take their next
step in constructive art by attempting to form such utensils
as might contain, and enable them to preserve, the fruits and
seeds necessary for food. Assuming that they were then
unprovided with even the rudest tools,—for we refer to a
time before our far-off ancestors knew the use of bronze or
iron,—they would form these utensils by twisting together
the long, pliant osiers with which the land abounded, and of
which, by the unaided action of the fingers, they could form
baskets excellently adapted for the required purpose.</p>

<p>No other branch of art is even now so independent of
tools, and none has been so universally diffused or so long
and uninterruptedly practised as basket making. It is the
humble parent of all textile art, the most elaborate tissues
produced by the loom or the needle being but progressive
developements proceeding from the rude wattle-work of
unclothed savages. Basket making is the first natural step
in the path of civilization. To this day the earliest effort of
infantile ingenuity among the rural population is directed to
making (as it were by intuitive instinct) personal ornaments
of plaited rushes, and that, too, in patterns, some of which
are identical with the devices engraved by our pre-historic
ancestors on their old sculptured stones.</p>

<p>The earliest authentic records of Britain refer to its inhabitants
as expert basket makers; their houses were made of
willows and reeds; their fences and fortifications were living
trees, with intertwisted branches; their boats were baskets,
covered with skins; their domestic furniture, defensive
armour, even the images employed in their erroneous religion,
were each of wicker-work; and though we have no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
absolute proof that such was the case, it is at least probable
that those famous chariots so formidable to the Roman
invaders were similarly constructed, for it appears altogether
impossible that the feats recorded of these celebrated charioteers
could have been performed with carriages of wood
and iron; though if we can suppose them to have been of
small size, constructed of elastic wicker-work, and placed
upon low wheels, the accounts of their marvellous movements
become reasonable, and within the bounds of credibility.</p>

<p>The monastic historians of the succeeding ages continue
to mention wicker-work as the principal architectural material
used in Britain and Ireland, not only for the rude
dwellings of the inhabitants, but also for their more important
public edifices and churches. Thus we find that so late
as the sixth century Dermot MacKervel assisted “the Abbot
St. Keyran to make a house to dwell in” by “thrusting
down the peirs or wattles” of which it was made.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The
monastery founded by St. Columba in the same century,
though of much theological repute, must have had little
material grandeur, as it is known that the great apostle of
the Scots “sent forth his monks to gather twigs to build
their hospice,” and the abode of St. Woloc, a bishop of the
same age, was “a simple hut of wattles.” Glastonbury,
supposed to have been the earliest Christian church in
England, was, on the authority of William of Malmesbury,<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
“a mean structure of wattle-work;” and there are numerous
other references to churches and monasteries constructed
altogether or in part of the same material. Vestiges of
such structures are now occasionally met with, which verify
the records of the Roman and Mediæval historians. Recently,
on the Etive in Argyleshire, the progress of agricultural
improvement has uncovered rough pavements of stone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
bearing marks of fire strewed with charred ashes, surrounded
with the remains of hazel stakes, the relics of the frame-work
of ancient Caledonian hearths, which have been concealed for
centuries under a cover of eight or ten feet of moss.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Many of the purposes to which the ancient Briton applied
his manufacture of baskets were singularly useful, and so
well were they adapted to their peculiar purposes that they
are employed almost unchanged even to the present day.
The coracle of basket and hide is still used by sportsmen and
poachers on the waters of North Wales.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> The bothies of
the Scottish Highlanders are yet constructed of wattles; and
even in the cottages of a better kind the doors and sleeping
cribs are frequently of the same fabric: so also are their
rude little sledges and carts; and until of late their horse
harness also.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Modern civilization does not now disdain
to use for drags, dog-carts, and German waggons the same
strong yet light and elastic materials which the ancient
Briton probably employed for his formidable war-chariot;
and our ancestors of the last century knew well the value of
the stage-coach “<em>basket</em>” as a convenient means of conveyance
over their rough roads.</p>

<p>“Hanapers (or hampers) of twyggys” were long the official
receptacles for certain documents connected with the Court
of Chancery, and the name is still, or was recently, applied
to an officer of that court.</p>

<p>The firm hold with which long-established customs, combined
with convenience, fix themselves upon the reason of
men, and the pertinacity with which nations cling to their
old habits, refusing, for the sake of old associations, alterations
of the most obvious utility, is altogether marvellous.
Speaking of this power and permanency of custom, Lord
Bacon curiously illustrates this subject by an anecdote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
pertinent to the matter before us. “I remember, in the
beginning of Queen Elizabeth’s time, of England, an Irish
rebel condemned, put up a petition to the Deputy that he
should be hanged in a withe, and not in an halter, because it
had been so used with former rebels.”<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Another author,
in his version of the same story, says that this “favour of
being hanged in gads (twisted withes, so called after the
manner of the country), was not refused.”<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> This, though
probably an extreme, is by no means an unique prejudice in
favour of ancient modes of execution, a prejudice which
extends beyond life, influencing nations in their adherence to
old-established sepulchral customs.</p>

<p>A manufacture which was probably progressing for many
centuries before the Romans invaded Britain, must necessarily
have acquired a certain amount of refined ornament as a
result of so much experience and practice. We have, indeed,
direct evidence that the Romans greatly admired the ornamental
baskets of the British, which were exported in large
quantities to Rome, and became fashionable appendages
among the extravagantly luxurious furniture of the imperial
city. Juvenal, writing about <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 120, mentions the popularity
of these baskets;<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and that they were productions
of the British islanders is distinctly stated by the epigrammatist
Martial,<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> who wrote about the end of the first
century. It is not improbable that these British baskets
were enriched with colour, and even gilding. The former
we know was profusely and permanently applied to the
persons of the aborigines; the latter—probably one of the
earliest discovered metals—was used in the middle of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
fifth century for so common a purpose as decorating the
roofs of important buildings.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> It is not, therefore, likely
that they were denied as additional means of ornament to
these highly valued baskets.</p>

<p>When the aboriginal Briton had made his first step in
domestic civilization by constructing useful baskets, he would
still be subjected to a great inconvenience from the absence
of any suitable vessel of sufficient size to convey or store a
supply of water. Nature in this country did little to assist
him, denying even the slight aid of the gourd and calabash
common in warmer climates. To invent a water vessel would
thus become to him a necessity; without it he must have
been compelled to reside on the bank of some river or brook,
in which he and his family could quench their thirst in the
same manner and as frequently as the wild animals of the
surrounding forests. Nor is it improbable that many generations
of people were restricted to such localities for this
reason.</p>

<p>There appears at first sight to be no possible analogy
between baskets and water vessels; yet I apprehend that
they are in reality almost twin inventions. The same reasoning
which induced the naked Briton to line the wicker walls
of his hut with clay for the purpose of excluding cold, would,
after some experience, lead to an application of the same
material as a coating to the inside of his baskets, which,
when dried in the sun or hardened by fire applied to the
inside, would then be enabled to retain liquids at least for a
time, and consequently permit the desired migration from
the immediate margin of a river. This is of course a gratuitous
assertion, of no value without proof; but it is also a
reasonable induction, and one which is, I venture to think,
worthy the considerate attention of archæologists.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>Fortunately vessels of this description have been preserved
in the ancient burial places of the Britons, and are occasionally
exhumed in a state of tolerable preservation. They
are for the most part not turned on the potter’s wheel, but
moulded by the hand, and marked on the exterior by ornaments,
not in relief, but always depressed or incised, having
the appearance of indentations made in the soft clay by
plaited osiers, rushes, or strips of hide, more or less distinct,
but, so far as I know, all referrible to such an origin.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> In
some the coating of clay appears not to be carried to the
mouth of the basket, but the plaited rushes seem to have
been folded inside, and thus the interior of the urn is on its
upper portions indented with the same pattern of basket-work
as that on the outer side. All British urns are,
comparatively with Roman or with Saxon examples, wide-mouthed,
a condition essential to their being made by hand
on an exterior frame-work of plaited rushes or willows; and
some appear to have been constructed on two separate
baskets, one inverted over the other. There is rarely any
attempt at <em>ansation</em>, the nearest approach to handles being
heavy perforated knobs placed a little beneath the mouth,
for the evident purpose of attaching to them the twigs,
withes, or thongs, which served both to protect and to
suspend these fragile vessels.</p>

<p>I must not be supposed to assert that the ornaments
found on British, occasionally on Anglo-Roman, and abundantly
on Anglo-Saxon urns, were in all cases real impressions
of basket-work; but merely that the use of that style
of ornament probably originated in the manner I have
described, and that it was continued after the introduction
of the potter’s wheel by force of habit and long-continued
custom. This induced the potter to stamp or incise on the
surface of the vessels he made ornamental devices similar to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
those on the honoured urns of an earlier people; for that
they were honoured and held in high estimation is apparent
from the sacred purposes to which they were applied as
receptacles for the ashes of the dead. In absence of all
direct proof of this assumed origin of urn ornamentation, I
have thought it right to test the possibility of the process;—with
a result entirely satisfactory. Taking such small
baskets as I found used by my family for ordinary domestic
purposes, I have roughly coated them inside with different
clays, subjecting some to the action of fire in the kiln, while
others I have left exposed to the sun, and to a few I have
applied heat inside only. On all the indentations of the
basket-work are sufficiently marked; but they are best
defined on the sun-dried specimens, since the shrinking of
the clay under the action of fire in the kiln obliterates some
of the more salient ridges. A comparison of these jars with
ancient British urns will, I apprehend, be more satisfactory
and convincing than any elaborate argument, leaving little
doubt that both have been produced by similar processes,
and that the British urn is, in truth, a secondary application
of the British basket.</p>

<p>Mr. Birch, in his learned and most valuable <cite>History of
Ancient Pottery</cite>, applies the term “<i lang="la">bascaudæ</i>,” employed by
Juvenal and Martial, not to baskets but to sepulchral urns
with basket-like ornamentation.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Though most unwilling
to hazard a contrary opinion, I still cannot avoid suggesting
that such urns, judging from the specimens which have been
preserved for our inspection, were not likely to be acceptable
ornaments on the tables of the luxurious Romans, accustomed
as they must have been to elegant products of high art in the
plastic manufactures of Etruria, Greece, and Egypt. It is, I
think, greatly more probable that ornamental baskets to
contain fruit or flowers were indicated by that name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>Though there is good proof that the Britons had acquired
much skill in the art of basket making at the time of the
occupation of this island by the Romans, it is equally certain
that they were ignorant of the art of constructive masonry;
for when the legions left the British to their own resources,
they advised them to build a wall between the two seas across
the island, to keep off their northern enemies. They, indeed,
“raised the wall as they had been directed,” but “not of
stone <em>as having no artist capable of such work</em>, but of sods
[which] made it of no use.”<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> From this it is apparent
that the British people at that time, and probably for some
centuries afterwards, were unaccustomed to the use of building
materials of a kind more permanent than wood, wattle-work
and clay. Such an arrangement quite accords with the
manners of the people and the state of the country at that
period, covered as it was with extensive forests, and swamps
abounding with osiers. A people of migratory habits,
occupied in perpetual warfare, and depending in a great
measure on the chase for their food, must have had little
inducement to build residences of great durability; and
this would happily lead to the more rapid clearing of the
country, and consequently to its earlier civilization.</p>

<p>Such was the condition of art in Britain and Ireland at the
time that the first Christian missionaries commenced their
labours in these countries. So signal was their success that
Tertullian, writing of his own time (the third century), tells
us that “some countries of the Britains that proved impregnable
to the Romans are yet subjected to Christ.” It was
the custom of those earnest and indefatigable men (so pious
in their lives that after their death they were usually
honoured with the title of Saint) to place crosses in every
place where they succeeded in making converts, or in which
they planted a church, chapel, or monastery; and it becomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
a question of some interest to ascertain the materials of these
early symbols of the Christian faith, which must have been
extensively spread over the land.</p>

<p>Clearly they were not of stone, since we know that even
after the Romans left England the natives had not sufficient
skill to build a wall of that material; nor have we any reason
to believe that they had the ability or the tools requisite for
the construction of a cross of timber, which would demand
the use of cutting instruments with finer edges than those
necessary for stone. Under these circumstances it is only
natural that the British convert would dedicate to the glory
of God the products of that talent which had acquired for
him a continental celebrity. The basket-work, so prized at
Rome, was the most valuable oblation that the pious ancient
Briton could offer to the services of his new religion, and
thus it was that the first emblems of Christianity erected in
England were (almost necessarily) constructed of basket-work.</p>

<p>The perishable nature of the materials forbids us to expect
almost any other than inferential evidence that crosses of
basket-work ever existed, but happily this is not denied to us.
A careful examination of the admirable engravings of the
sculptured stones of Scotland, the ancient Irish crosses, and
the curious monumental remains of the Isle of Man, together
with many existing carved crosses in England and Wales,
cannot fail to convince any unprejudiced observer that the
beautiful interlaced ornamentation so lavishly employed on
these sculptures derived its origin from the earlier decorations
of that British basket-work which the Romans had learned
to value and admire.</p>

<p>Before attempting to describe the method by which such
crosses may be, and probably were constructed, I beg to call
attention to the fact that basket-work and the earlier Pagan
or Druidical religion were closely connected.</p>

<p>Cæsar, writing of the Druids, states that “they have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
images of enormous size, the limbs of which, formed of
wicker-work, they fill with living men, which being set on
fire, the men perish enveloped in flames<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>;” and Strabo says,
“having prepared a Colossus of hay and thrown wood upon
it, they burn together oxen, all sorts of wild beasts, and
men.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>” It has been assumed that these wicker-work
images were in the human form, but I apprehend that there
is nothing in either text to warrant this conclusion. The
word colossus implies a figure of large size, which may quite
as probably have been that of some enormous animal.</p>

<p>On the Shandwick stone,<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> one of the most interesting of
the Scottish series, figures of men, horses, stags, birds, and
other animals are carved with much spirit, and with more
than usual attention to their relative proportions. The animals
are represented in life-like attitudes, as if moving about.
But there is one remarkable exception,<a name="FNanchor_21a" id="FNanchor_21a"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> a colossal four-legged
creature, of a form peculiar to these Scottish stones,
differs from the others as much in figure as in size. Compared
with two sheep and a dog which occur on the same
panel,<a name="FNanchor_21b" id="FNanchor_21b"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> its height, if erect, would be about thirteen feet, its
length about eighteen feet, while its ungainly leaning posture
is singularly suggestive of its being a sculptured representation
of some huge beast built up of wicker-work. Certain
marks on its surface warrant this supposition, which is
strengthened by the fact that other representations of a similar
animal, which occur on the same series, have the most
distinct indications of a basket-work origin. Well marked
examples are to be found on the stones at Brodie and at
Glenferness.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Resembling no known animal, these curious
figures—which are represented above twenty times on the
Scottish stones and are nowhere else to be met with—have
a general likeness to each other; they are all in postures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
by no means indicating life or motion, and all distinguished
by the striking peculiarity of having no feet; the limbs terminate
in long wands rolled up after the manner of volutes,
obviously suggesting the idea that if opened out they would
serve, on being thrust deeply into the ground, to keep the
colossus in a standing attitude. Similar volutes are represented
terminating the base of the well-known cross at the
gate of St. Michael’s church yard in the Isle of Man. They
were probably used in the same way to fix to the ground an
earlier cross of wicker-work, of which the existing monument
is a copy engraved on stone.</p>

<p>I dare not of course take it upon me to assert that there is
any positive connection between the huge animal on the
Shandwick stone and the colossal images mentioned by
Cæsar and Strabo, as being employed by the Druids in their
human sacrifices, but the coincidence (if indeed it be not
something more) is sufficiently curious and interesting to
demand a passing notice. It is supposed that these and
some other as yet inexplicable devices found on the same
stones are symbols of a religion prior to Christianity; a circumstance
by no means improbable, as it is known that convents
among the Saxons and probably the Britons also, clung
with much pertinacity to some of their Druidical and Pagan
customs long after they had assumed the outward emblems
of Christianity. This may account for the juxtaposition of
the cross with devices of unknown meaning, and explain in
some degree the remarkable circumstance that Pagan and
Christian emblems both derive their ornamentation from the
same source—basket-work.</p>

<p>Having shown that at the time when Christianity was
introduced into Britain the native population, totally unacquainted
with practical masonry, were yet expert and experienced
manufacturers of highly ornamental baskets; and
suggested the reasonable probability that they would employ
their best talents in the service of their new religion, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
they had previously devoted them to their earlier Pagan or
Druidical superstitions, I proceed to offer some reasons for
believing that the first crosses erected by Christian missionaries
in Britain, Ireland, and the Isle of Man, were
constructed of plaited osiers.</p>

<p>Many of the Mediæval biographers narrate with much
minuteness the particulars of stone crosses set up by Christian
bishops; but no such notices occur before the sixth
century, and from the great importance attached to them by
the monastic historians, it is evident that they were objects
of extraordinary interest, and moreover, of <em>exceptional material</em>.
Such crosses were erected by St. Columba, St.
Oswald, St. Cuthbert, Bishop Ethelwold, and other holy
men. Of St. Kentigern—better known in Scotland as St.
Mungo—it is said that, among many crosses which he put
up, one in the city of Glasgow was taken from the quarry by
his orders, and, by the united efforts of many men, erected
in the cemetery of the Church of the Holy Trinity, in which
his episcopal throne was set up. That this particular cross
was of more than usual importance may be inferred from the
statement of his biographer, that it was the custom of St. Kentigern
to erect a cross in any place where he had converted
the people, or had for a time resided. Such crosses, therefore,
must have been executed by some less laborious process
than was used for the one which he erected near his cathedral
about the end of the sixth century, and which is said to have
still marked the spot where the original edifice stood, when
the Cathedral of the West was reconstructed five hundred
years afterwards.</p>

<p>But St. Kentigern erected one other cross, which demands
the attention and consideration of archæologists.
We are informed that at Locherward, a parish in Mid-Lothian
now called Borthwick, he set up a cross constructed
of <em>sea sand</em>. There is no hint of any miraculous assistance
in the erection of this cross, and therefore we are constrained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
to look for some mechanical appliance by which sea sand
could be made to cohere in the form of a cross.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>But first I may be permitted to suggest a possible motive
for the adoption of a material so unstable, and apparently so
little fitted for the purpose.</p>

<p>Locherward (now Borthwick) is a considerable inland
property in the east of Scotland, and for some reasons, not
requisite to be inquired into here, this parish was appended
to the Western Diocese of Cumbria, which comprised the
valley of the Clyde and much of the west coast of Scotland
during the episcopate of St. Kentigern. It is not improbable,
then, that this cross-rearing Bishop would commemorate so
important an event, in his accustomed manner, by sending
to Locherward a cross of baskets made of the osiers and
filled with the sea sand of his western diocese, which, having
been sanctified by his episcopal benediction, would be appropriately
set up in his new territory as a visible sign of the
transfer, and a practical assertion of his accession to the
property. Here again, however, I am compelled to say that
I have not a shadow of proof to offer in support of my
surmise. St. Kentigern may have set up the sea-sand cross
by other means, and for another purpose. I have only
endeavoured to suggest a reason in accordance with possibility
and the customs of the times in which he lived.</p>

<p>Before asking you to believe that the earliest existing stone
crosses were reproductions of still earlier crosses of twigs, I
may well be expected to offer some evidence that any such
basket-work crosses ever existed.</p>

<p>Of all the superstitious legends of the middle ages, none
was more widely popular than that of St. Patrick’s purgatory.
The little island in gloomy Lough Derg, in which it was believed
that both the pains and advantages of purgatory could
be anticipated, and the duration of its torments abridged, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
visited by great and powerful pilgrims, who enriched its
clerical guardians by their offerings. Suppressed at the
Reformation, and its rude buildings more than once demolished
by the orders of government, it nevertheless still
retains so strong a grasp on the superstitious feelings of the
poor and ignorant of the present day, that, actuated by
religious enthusiasm, crowds of such pilgrims at certain
seasons pour themselves upon this miserable little islet,
consisting of three roods of barren surface; and so numerous
are these visitors that the tenant pays the landlord a yearly
rent of £300 (the greater part in sixpences), derived from a
small charge imposed on them at the ferry toll.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>In this place, where ancient superstitious practices still
linger, the remembrance of its founder and his imputed miracles
would naturally be longest retained, and any relics appertaining
to him preserved with pertinacious care. None
such can now be found; but it is recorded that about or before
the year 1630, a certain Lord Dillon visited the island, accompanied
by a government surveyor, and they gave a detailed
description of the place, which was published by the then
Bishop of the Diocese. In their report it is stated that “at
the east end of the church there is a heap of stones, on which
there is <em>a cross made of interwoven twigs</em>; this is known by
the name of St. Patrick’s Altar, on which there do lie three
pieces of a bell, which they say St. Patrick used to carry in
his hand,” &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> This is the only record I have met with
of any actual cross of twigs or basket-work. It was probably
the last of innumerable crosses of the same kind, and
was found in the place where, of all others, the latest example
was likely to be met with. Doubtless it was a many times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
repeated copy of some ancient cross attributed originally to
the hands of the patron saint of Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>The devices sculptured on a majority of the Scottish and
Manx monoliths must have been executed before the artists
possessed such skill or such tools as would enable them to
cut the outline of the stone itself to any required form; they
do not appear at that time to have <em>set up</em> crosses, but they
engraved representations of that symbol on the surface of huge
stones many of which were already fixed in an erect position
and most probably had been for a long series of years employed
in the services of an earlier religion. Upon such stones they
imitated the ornamentation of wicker-work by innumerable
reiterated blows of their small celts of flint, bronze, or iron,
working out the design in low relief, and showing one half of
the round, or as much only of the osier wands as could be
seen when plaited together. It is only in the later examples
that the outline of the stone assumes the form of the cross;
and this change is accompanied by a considerable alteration
in the ornamental details, the interlacings become less elegant
but more complicated, and terminate in the heads, tails, and
limbs of various animals, often grotesque in expression; or,
the wands burst into buds and leaves, or give place entirely
to sculptured representations of men and animals of the
rudest execution. It is a curious proof of the earlier use of
the interwoven ornamentation that it may be found in
elegantly arranged and highly-finished devices on the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
stones with representations of the human figure so rudely
carved as to appear to be the work of mere children.</p>

<p>It may be objected, that the British or Saxon artisan, when
working on a new material, would adopt a style of ornament
appropriate to it, and discard the totally irrelevant system of
decoration which had been used by his ancestors; but it
must be remembered that he had many inducements to
adhere to the ancient patterns. The force of custom and
education would be a powerful motive, and no other style of
ornament was then known to the people, who were accustomed
to and well understood these endless intricacies which appear
to us a mass of confusion; probably, however, the best
reason was an earnest desire to perpetuate in durable material
those crosses of perishable basket-work, before which he and
his ancestors had bowed themselves in worship in the depths
of their primæval forests,—crosses, which had been sanctified
by the holy men who at first erected them, and to many of
which miraculous powers were undoubtedly attributed.</p>

<p>A majority of the Irish examples differ from those of Scotland
and the Isle of Man, in being elaborately carved in their
outline to the form of richly ornamented crosses. This argues
either an earlier developement of art in Ireland, or a later
execution of the work; but the plaited ornaments are found
to prevail in each locality, though they probably gave place
to sculptured representations of men and animals somewhat
earlier in Ireland than elsewhere. The usual form of these
crosses is fairly expressed by the example engraved<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> representing
the interesting Irish cross at Kilklespeen.</p>

<p>It may at first sight be supposed that crosses of timber
would precede those of stone, the material being abundant and
the workmanship apparently more easy; but a little consideration
will show that timber required tools of a higher
order than stone; the blunt celt would be far from efficient
as an instrument to carve wood, and sharp-edged tools were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
not then attainable. Irrespective of this, the superior durability
of stone would of itself induce the choice of that
material.</p>

<p>There is a common arrangement in most of the Scottish
and Irish crosses to which I desire to call attention; whether
sculptured into true crosses, or merely engraved on the surface
of the stone, they are divided into irregular compartments,
each for the most part ornamented with a different device of
interlaced work, or, in late examples, subjects in sculpture.
These compartments are usually broad at the base and gradually
decrease in size towards the apex of the cross, as would
be the case with a series of baskets piled upon each other,
and then firmly bound together by continuous bands of
twisted withes. A wheel or ring, connecting the horizontal
with the perpendicular limbs almost invariably accompanies
the interlaced ornamentation on these early crosses. This
ring I long supposed to represent a nimbus or glory, but
remembering that that usual symbol of divinity is of Eastern
origin, and that it is commonly met with on crosses where
there is no representation of the figure of our Lord, I was
induced to seek for some other meaning, and have now no
hesitation in saying that its original purpose was not symbolical,
or even merely ornamental, but that it was a necessary
appliance in the construction of the earlier wicker-work
crosses, reproduced on the stone crosses for the same reasons
which induced the retention of the interlaced ornaments.</p>

<p>It is obvious that the horizontal arms of a basket-work
cross must require some extraneous aid to enable them to
retain that position even for a short time. For this purpose
the ring seemed to me to have been adopted; but I was
quite unable to discover the manner in which it was applied,
until on application to a practical basket-maker I was at once
told that he could not construct a cross of willows without
the ring, which he must make first, and then work the cross
upon it. That such was its use is confirmed by the arrangement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
of some of the rude crosses in the Isle of Man. On
the sculptured stone in the church-yard of Kirk Michael<a name="FNanchor_28a" id="FNanchor_28a"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
is a cross of interlaced work without any ring; but to compensate
for its absence another contrivance has been adopted.
The horizontal arms are sustained by a series of plaited twigs
hung over the top of the upper limb, and interwoven with
the arms. On the reverse of the same stone<a name="FNanchor_28b" id="FNanchor_28b"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> the cross has
a ring composed of one thick and two slender stems, which
last appear to pass through and fasten together the limbs and
the ring by a curious and ingenious knot. Another example of
a similar fastening may be observed on the fragment of stone
also at Kirk Michael<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> sculptured with a rude representation
of the crucifixion. These knots are doubtless the origin of
the richly ornamented bosses often covered with basket-work,
so frequently met with in exactly the same positions on the
Irish and Scottish crosses.</p>

<p>Some of the human figures sculptured on the Scottish and
Manx stones, are so executed as to suggest that they also are
reproductions from originals formed of twigs. This is particularly
the case with a fragment at Forteviot,<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> the ancient
Celtic capital of Scotland, on which four men, some animals
and a cross are carved with curious rudeness; and with a
portion of another crucifixion from the Isle of Man.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Both
of these have a considerable resemblance to the rustic work
of rough twigs with which many gardeners of the present day
delight to ornament their summer houses and garden seats.
These examples suggest a common origin with the extraordinary
illuminations which Mr. Westwood has reproduced
from ancient manuscripts, particularly with those engraved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
in the <cite>Journal of the Archæological Institute</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> it being
remembered that the sculpture and the illuminations were
both probably enriched with colour and gilding.</p>

<p>I have made careful copies of very numerous examples of
ancient interlaced ornaments, and placed them in the hands
of various artisans, particularly basket-makers, straw-plaiters,
wire-workers, and plaiters of ornamental hair. They all
inform me that with a few exceptions the devices may be
worked out in their respective materials, and several thanked
me for putting new patterns before them, which they said
would be useful in their business. Some of these drawings
I gave to my own workpeople, who reproduced the devices
very effectively in braid-work and embroidery. They tell me
they could, with time and patience, copy many of the most
elaborate devices.</p>

<p>I must guard myself, however, against being supposed to
assert that <em>all</em> the interlaced devices found on the old crosses
may be reproduced in modern plait work; such is not the
case. Many of them may claim some other and very different
origin, and there are others which the sculptor has doubtless
modified and altered. The first Corinthian capital is said to
have been modelled from a flower-pot covered with a tile
between which the leaves of an acanthus had forced themselves,
an arrangement which skilful architects have varied a
hundred different ways, though retaining still the expression
of the original idea. In the same spirit the ancient Briton
treated the panels of basket-work, when he reproduced them
on his crosses of stone.</p>

<p>There are many other branches of British and Irish art
which may have been influenced in their origin by the long
established basket-work of these islands, such as the early
enamelling of metals, the Norman arcades, especially those
found on very early fonts, the branching arrangement of the
oldest window glass, as well as the reticulated manner of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
placing glazing quarries, and very numerous varieties of
mediæval diapering; but I omit farther notice of these. My
purpose in this paper is merely to call attention to the probable
origin of one branch of ancient art which I believe to
have escaped previous notice. If I have in any degree
established my position, or even excited curiosity respecting
it, it will doubtless induce further inquiry and discussion,
since it is beyond doubt a subject of very considerable
interest.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
